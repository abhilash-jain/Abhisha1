Hi this is a test file so that our master drectory can work as we want. # 1st commit.

This is my First line after 1st commit is done. #To be commited on 2nd commit

This is my second line after 1st commit : # --> this is our 3rd commit to this file.

This is line from GIT GUI to check merge testing.
This is first line from git bash to check merge conflicts

# Lines from master_Child1.

1.This branch is created to make changes to readme file, merge to master branch and get itself deleted as not required later.
2.so lets work on it.

#Lines added to check Git stash working

1. this line will be added to file but will not be committed to master branch for now.
2.will check how git stash works

3.lets add one line for jenkins to check if git hook catches this line and change on git
